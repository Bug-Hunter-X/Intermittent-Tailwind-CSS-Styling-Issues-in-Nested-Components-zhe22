This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when a component's styles are not applied correctly, leading to unexpected visual results or missing styles. This often happens when the component is imported into another component or page and its styles do not cascade down correctly, despite apparently correct class usage.  It may manifest as styles being completely absent or partially applied.
