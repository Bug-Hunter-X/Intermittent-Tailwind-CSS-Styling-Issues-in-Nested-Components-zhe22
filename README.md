# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Issues in Nested Components

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles do not consistently apply in nested React components within a Next.js application. The problem is intermittent, making debugging challenging.  The bug.js file showcases the problematic component structure and the bugSolution.js file offers a potential solution involving ensuring proper class propagation and style inheritance.

## Problem Description

The primary issue is that styles defined in parent components are not always inherited or applied correctly by child components. This inconsistency appears to be related to the order of component rendering or some other timing issue within the framework.  Styles are sometimes correctly applied, while other times they are completely missing.  The exact cause is unclear due to the intermittent nature of the bug.

## Potential Solutions

The provided solution in bugSolution.js attempts to address the problem by explicitly handling style propagation and ensuring that Tailwind's directives are correctly applied at the appropriate level of the component hierarchy. This may involve refactoring components or adjusting the way CSS is imported and applied within the application.
