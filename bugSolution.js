The solution involves several strategies:

1. **Explicitly applying styles:** Instead of relying on inheritance, explicitly apply the Tailwind CSS classes to the specific elements within the child components. This ensures that the styles are directly applied, regardless of the component structure.

2. **Using the `@apply` directive judiciously:** For more complex styles, use the `@apply` directive in your Tailwind CSS configuration file. This allows for better control over style inheritance and application.

3. **Check for conflicting styles:**  Inspect the browser's developer tools for any conflicting styles that may be overriding your Tailwind CSS classes.

4. **Purge unused styles:** Ensure that your build process correctly purges unused styles to prevent any potential conflicts.

5. **Ensure correct import order:** Check that your Tailwind CSS files are correctly imported and that the import order is consistent across your project.

Example (bugSolution.js):

```javascript
// ... component structure ...
<div className="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  {/* Explicitly apply styles to child component */}
  <ChildComponent className="text-blue-500 font-bold" />
</div>
```
By applying these strategies, you can help mitigate and resolve the inconsistent application of Tailwind CSS styles in your nested React components.
